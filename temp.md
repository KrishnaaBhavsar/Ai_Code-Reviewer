❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+ b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or passed as
arguments. This will lead to an error or use variables from the global scope, which is bad practice.
* ❌ The function lacks clear documentation or comments, making it difficult to understand its purpose and usage quickly.
* ❌ There is no explicit handling of potential errors or validation of input types.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new Error('Both arguments must be numbers.');
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, allowing it to receive the numbers to be added.
* ✔️ Added input validation to ensure both arguments are numbers, throwing an error if they are not.
* ✔️ Included JSDoc-style comments to document the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.

Final Note:

By providing explicit parameters and input validation, the `sum` function becomes more robust and easier to use. The
JSDoc comments improve readability and maintainability, aligning with high coding standards.
